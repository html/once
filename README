Once
====

Imagine situation where you have to call the code in many layouts/partials/views and code must be executed only once. 
Can't ? :), see example

Example
=======

You need to load jquery (or any other javascript library) in two different partials ('_pagination.haml' and '_image_gallery.haml')
You can include
    =javascript_include_tag 'jquery'
in partials. If both are rendered on the page there will be duplication of 
    <script src="/javascripts/jquery.js?XXX" type="text/javascript"></script>

The solution is "Once" :)
Instead of 
    =javascript_include_tag 'jquery'
You write
    =once :load_jquery { javascript_include_tag 'jquery' }

You can simplify jquery loading by defining helper in app/helpers/application_helper.erb

  def javascript_include_jquery 
      once(:load_jquery) {
          javascript_include_tag 'jquery.min'
      }
  end

or even 

  def javascript_require_jquery 
      once(:load_jquery) do
          content_for :script do
              javascript_include_tag 'jquery'
          end
      end
  end
